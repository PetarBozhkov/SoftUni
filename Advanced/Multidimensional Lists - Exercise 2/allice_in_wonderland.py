#5. Alice in Wonderland
#Alice is going to the mad tea party, to see her friends. On the way to the party, she needs to collect bags of tea.
#You will be given an integer n for the size of the Wonderland territory with a square shape. 
#On the following n lines, you will receive the rows of the territory:
#路 Alice will be placed in a random position, marked with the letter "A".
#路 On the territory, there will be bags of tea, represented as numbers. 
#If Alice steps on a number position, she collects the tea bags and increases the quantity with the corresponding number.
#路 There will always be one rabbit hole on the territory marked with the letter "R".
#路 All of the empty positions will be marked with ".".
#After the field state, you will be given commands for Alice's movements. Move commands can be: "up", "down", "left" or "right".
#When Alice collects at least 10 bags of tea, she is ready to go to the tea party, and she does not need to continue collecting. 
#Otherwise, if she steps on the rabbit hole or goes out of the territory, she can't return, and the program ends.
#In the end, the path she walked had to be marked with '*'.
#For more clarifications, see the examples below.
