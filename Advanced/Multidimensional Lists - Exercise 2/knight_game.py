#3. Knight Game
#Chess is the oldest game, but it is still popular these days. It will be used only one chess piece for this task - the Knight.
#A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated. 
#It can move to the nearest square but not on the same row, column, or diagonal. 
#(e.g., it can move two squares horizontally, then one square vertically, or it can move one square horizontally then two squares vertically - i.e., in an "L" pattern.)
#The knight game is played on a board with dimensions N x N.
#You will receive a board with "K" for knights and "0" for empty cells. 
#Your task is to remove knights until no knights that can attack one another with one move are left.
#Always remove the knight who can attack the greatest number of knights. 
#If there are two or more knights with the same number of attacks, remove the top-left one
