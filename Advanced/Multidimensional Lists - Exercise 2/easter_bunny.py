#4. Easter Bunny

#Your task is to collect as many eggs as possible.

#On the first line, you will be given a number representing the size of the field. On the following few lines, you will be given a field with:

#· One bunny - randomly placed in it and marked with the symbol "B"

#· Number of eggs placed at different positions of the field and traps marked with "X"

#Your job is to determine the direction in which the bunny should go to collect the maximum number of eggs. 
#The directions that should be considered as possible are up, down, left, and right. If you reach a trap while checking some of the directions, you should not consider the fields after the trap in this direction. For more clarifications, see the examples below.

#Note: Consider ONLY the paths from which the bunny has collected 1 or more eggs.
