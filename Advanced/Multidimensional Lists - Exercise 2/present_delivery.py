#7. Present Delivery
#The presents are ready, and Santa has to deliver them to the kids.
#You will receive an integer m for the number of presents Santa has and an integer n for the size of the neighborhood with a square shape. 
#On the following lines, you will receive the matrix, which represents the neighborhood.
#Santa will be in a random cell, marked with the letter "S". Each cell stands for a house where children may live. 
#If the cell has "X" on it, that means there lives a naughty kid. Otherwise, if a nice kid lives there, the cell is marked by "V". 
#There can also be cells marked with "C" for cookies. All of the empty positions will be marked with "-".
#Santa can move "up", "down", "left", "right" with one position each time. These will be the commands that you receive. 
#If he moves to a house with a nice kid, the kid receives a present, but if Santa reaches a house with a naughty kid, he doesn't drop a present. 
#If the command sends Santa to a cell marked with "C", Santa eats cookies and becomes happy and extra generous to all the kids around him* (meaning all of them will receive presents - it doesn't matter if naughty or nice). 
#If Santa has been to a house, the cell becomes "-".
#Note: *around him means on his left, right, upwards, and downwards by one cell. 
#In this case, Santa doesn't move to these cells, or if he does, he returns to the cell where the cookie was.
#If Santa runs out of presents or receives the command "Christmas morning", you should end the program.
#Keep in mind that you should check whether all the nice kids received presents
