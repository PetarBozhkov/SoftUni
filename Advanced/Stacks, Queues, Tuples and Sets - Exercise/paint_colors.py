#6. Paint Colors
#You will have to find all possible color combinations that can be used.
#Write a program that finds colors in a string. 
#You will be given a string on a single line containing substrings (separated by a single space) from which you will be able to form the following colors:
#Main colors: "red", "yellow", "blue"
#Secondary colors: "orange", "purple", "green"
#To form a color, you should concatenate the first and the last substrings and check if you can get any of the above colors' names. 
#If there is only one substring left, you should use it to do the same check.
#You can only keep a secondary color if the two main colors needed for its creation could be formed from the given substrings:
#· orange = red + yellow
#· purple = red + blue
#· green = yellow + blue
#Note: You could find some of the main colors needed to keep a secondary color after it is found.
#When you form a color, remove both substrings. 
#Otherwise, you should remove the last character of each substring and return them in the middle of the original string. 
#If the string contains an odd number of substrings, you should put the substrings one position ahead.
#For example, if you are given the string "re yellow bye" you could not form a color with the substring "re" and "bye", 
#so you should remove the last character and return them in the middle of the string: "r by yellow".
#In the end, print out the list with colors in the order in which they are found
