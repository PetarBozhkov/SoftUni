#4. Numbers Filter
#Create a function called even_odd_filter() that can receive a different number of named arguments. 
#The keys will be "even" and/or "odd", and the values will be a list of numbers.
#When the key is "odd", you should extract only the odd numbers from its list. 
#When the key is "even", you should extract only the even numbers from its list.
#The function should return a dictionary sorted by the length of the lists in descending order. 
#There will be no case of lists with the same length.
