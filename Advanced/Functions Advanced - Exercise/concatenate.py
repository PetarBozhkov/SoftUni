#5. Concatenate
#Write a concatenate() function that receives some strings as arguments and some named arguments 
#(the key will be a string, and the value will be another string).
#First, you should concatenate all arguments successively.
#Next, take each key successively, and if it is present in the resulted string, change all matching parts with the key's value. 
#In the end, return the final string.

See the examples for more clarification.

def concatenate(*args, **kwargs):
    text = ''.join(args)

    for key in kwargs:
        text = text.replace(key, kwargs[key])

    return
