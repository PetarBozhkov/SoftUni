#8. *Bombs
#You will be given a square matrix of integers, each integer separated by a single space, and each row will be on a new line. 
#On the last line of input, you will receive indexes - coordinates of several cells separated by a single space, in the following format: 
#"{row1},{column1} {row2},{column2} â€¦ {row3},{column3}".
#On those cells, there are bombs. You must detonate every bomb in the order they were given. 
#When a bomb explodes, it deals damage equal to its integer value to all the cells around it (in every direction and in all diagonals). 
#One bomb can't explode more than once, and after it does, its value becomes 0. When a cell's value reaches 0 or below, it dies. Dead cells can't explode.
#You must print the count of all alive cells and their sum. Afterward, print the matrix with all its cells (including the dead ones).
