#6. Symbol in Matrix
#Write a program that reads a number - N, representing the rows and columns of a square matrix. 
#On the next N lines, you will receive rows of the matrix. Each row consists of ASCII characters. 
#After that, you will receive a symbol. Find the first occurrence of that symbol in the matrix and print its position in the format: "({row}, {col})". 
#You should start searching from the top left.
#If there is no such symbol, print the message "{symbol} does not occur in the matrix".
