#3. File Manipulator
#Create a program that will receive commands until the command "End". The commands can be:
#路 "Create-{file_name}" - Creates the given file with an empty content. If the file already exists, remove the existing text in it (as if the file is created again)
#路 "Add-{file_name}-{content}" - Append the content and a new line after it. If the file does not exist, create it, and add the content
#路 "Replace-{file_name}-{old_string}-{new_string}" - Open the file and replace all the occurrences of the old string with the new string.If the file does not exist, print: "An error occurred"
#路 "Delete-{file_name}" - Delete the file. If the file does not exist, print: "An error occurred"
