#7. *Robotics
#There is a robotics factory. The current project is assembly-line robots.
#Each robot has a processing time â€“ it is the time in seconds the robot needs to process a product. 
#When a robot is free, it should take a product for processing and log its name, product, and processing start time.
#Each robot processes a product coming from the assembly line. 
#A product is coming from the line each second (so the first product should appear at [start time + 1 second]). 
#If a product passes the line and there is not a free robot to take it, it should be queued at the end of the line again.
#The robots are standing in the line in the order of their appearance.
