#9. *Key Revolver
#Our favorite super-spy action hero Sam is back from his vacation, and it is time to go on a mission. 
#He needs to unlock a safe locked by several locks in a row, which all have varying sizes.
#The hero possesses a special weapon called the Key Revolver, with special bullets. 
#Each bullet can unlock a lock with a size equal to or larger than the size of the bullet. 
#The bullet goes into the keyhole, then explodes, completely destroying it. 
#Sam doesn't know the size of the locks, so he needs to just shoot at all of them until the safe runs out of locks.
#What's behind the safe, you ask? Well, intelligence! It is told that Sam's sworn enemy â€“ Nikoladze, keeps his top-secret Georgian Chacha Brandy recipe inside. 
#It's valued differently across different times of the year, so Sam's boss will tell him what it's worth over the radio. 
#One last thing, every bullet Sam fires will also cost him money, which will be deducted from his pay from the price of the intelligence.
#Good luck, operative.
