#5. Numbers Filter

#On the first line, you will receive a single number n. On the following n lines, you will receive integers. 
#After that, you will be given one of the following commands:

#路 even

#路 odd

#路 negative

#路 positive
#Filter all the numbers that fit in the category (0 counts as a positive and even). Finally, print the result.
