#5. Furniture

#Write a program that calculates the total cost of bought furniture.
#You will be given information about each purchase on separate lines until you receive the command "Purchase". 
#Valid information should be in the format: ">>{furniture_name}<<{price}!{quantity}". The price could be a floating-point or integer number. 
#You should store the names of the furniture and the total price.
#In the end, print the name of each bought furniture and the total cost, formatted to the second decimal point:

#"Bought furniture:

#{1st name}

#{2nd name}

#â€¦

#{N name}

#Total money spend: {total_cost}"
