#3. Statistics

#You seem to be doing great at your first job, so your boss decides to give you as your next task something more challenging. 
#You have to accept all the new products coming in the bakery and finally gather some statistics.
#You will be receiving key-value pairs on separate lines separated by ": " until you receive the command "statistics". 
#Sometimes you may receive a product more than once. In that case, you have to add the new quantity to the existing one. 
#When you receive the "statistics" command, print the following:

#"Products in stock:
#- {product1}: {quantity1}
#- {product2}: {quantity2}
#â€¦
#- {productN}: {quantityN}

#Total Products: {count_all_products}
#Total Quantity: {sum_all_quantities}"
