#5. Orders

#Write a function that calculates the total price of an order and returns it. 
#The function should receive one of the following products: "coffee", "coke", "water", or "snacks", and a quantity of the product. 
#The prices for a single piece of each product are:

#路 coffee - 1.50

#路 water - 1.00

#路 coke - 1.40

#路 snacks - 2.00

#Print the result formatted to the second decimal place.
